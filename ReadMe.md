## Trash Datathon Resources
This site will serve as a catalog of efforts around the state and beyond to better understand and respond to the problem of trash pollution through:
- improved data collection efforts and data standards
- assessment and characterization of that data to improve our understanding of the magnitude, distribition, and content of trash pollution (e.g., the magnitude and distribution of trash pollution across space and time, types of trash pollution and their relative magnitudes, etc.) 
- Use of trash data to analyze and/or predict the effects of trash pollution on environmental and public health
